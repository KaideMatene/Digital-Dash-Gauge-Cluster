# Emulator Controls Quick Reference

## Driving Modes (Press Number Keys)

```
0 = IDLE         (Engine idling, 1000 RPM)
1 = SLOW REV     (Gentle rev to 3000 RPM)
2 = MEDIUM REV   (Moderate rev to 5000 RPM)
3 = FAST REV     (Aggressive rev to 7000 RPM)
4 = HIGHWAY      (Steady cruise at 130 km/h)
5 = REDLINE      (Bouncing off redline 6500-8000)
6 = REALISTIC    (Full driving cycle)
```

## General Controls

```
SPACE  = Pause/Resume
n      = Night Mode (toggle)
h      = High Beam (toggle)
w      = Warning Light (toggle)
+      = Brightness Up
-      = Brightness Down
?      = Show Help
q/ESC  = Quit
```

## Game Controller Layout (if using gamepads)

```
Number Pad 0-6 for modes (or numpad)
```

## Quick Testing Workflow

1. **Start emulator:**
   ```
   python emulator.py
   ```

2. **Test each mode for 10 seconds:**
   ```
   Press 0 (idle) → wait 10s
   Press 1 (slow rev) → watch 2-3 cycles
   Press 2 (medium rev) → watch boost gauge
   etc.
   ```

3. **Verify all gauges responding:**
   - ✅ Tachometer needle moving
   - ✅ Speedometer updating
   - ✅ Fuel gauge decreasing
   - ✅ Temperature rising with load

4. **Test night mode:**
   ```
   Press n for dark theme
   Press n again for day theme
   ```

## What to Expect

### In IDLE mode (press 0):
- RPM bounces around 1000 (±200)
- Speed: 0 km/h
- Temperature: ~80°C
- Boost: 0.0 bar

### In SLOW REV mode (press 1):
- RPM climbs 1000 → 3000 over 10 seconds
- Speed climbs 0 → 40 km/h
- Temperature rises to ~85°C
- Boost rises to 0.1 bar
- Repeats every 10 seconds

### In HIGHWAY mode (press 4):
- RPM stays around 3500 (±300)
- Speed cruises at 130 km/h (±20)
- Temperature stable ~82°C
- Boost: 0.0 bar
- Very realistic steady-state operation

### In REDLINE mode (press 5):
- RPM bounces 6500 → 8000 every 4 seconds
- Very aggressive/racing behavior
- Temperature spikes to 90°C
- Boost up to 1.2 bar
- Good for testing redline zone rendering

## Troubleshooting

**Gauges not showing?**
- Make sure window is visible (check taskbar)
- Try `python emulator.py --fps 50` for default settings
- Check that all 3 gauges appear (Tachometer, Speedometer, Fuel)

**Modes not switching?**
- Make sure window is in focus (click on it first)
- Use number keys at top of keyboard (not numpad)
- Check console output shows "Mode switched to: IDLE" etc.

**Performance issues?**
- Close other programs (gaming, streaming, editing)
- Try `python emulator.py --fps 30` for slower FPS
- Update graphics drivers to latest version

## Pro Tips

1. **Pause while testing** - Press SPACE to freeze simulation
2. **Watch FPS counter** - Window title shows actual FPS
3. **Use fullscreen** - `python emulator.py --fullscreen`
4. **Mix controls** - Pause, switch night mode, switch modes, observe
5. **Try at different FPS** - `python emulator.py --fps 60` or `--fps 30`
